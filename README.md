# tindeer  

This is a landing page for a non-existent tinder knock-off app, for... deer.  
It was created solely as an exercise while practicing the usage of Bootstrap 4 (v4.3.1) in an HTML and CSS webpage.  

No deer were harmed during its creation.  

The actual landing page is at: [https://github.com/dimitristsaknakis/tindeer](https://github.com/dimitristsaknakis/tindeer)
